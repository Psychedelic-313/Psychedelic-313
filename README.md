### 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya — building systems at the intersection of **Android**, **AI**, and **backend architecture**. I care deeply about writing clean, intentional code that solves real-world problems, scales gracefully, and respects the user experience.

My work combines logic, design thinking, and long-term impact. I believe code should be as thoughtful as it is functional.

### 🚀 Current Focus

- 📱 Crafting modern Android apps with **Jetpack Compose**, **MVVM**, and **Firebase**
- 🧠 Exploring AI systems with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Prompt Engineering**
- 🛠️ Studying architecture for scalable backend tools (REST APIs, Django, PostgreSQL)
